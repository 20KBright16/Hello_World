Basic-learning for GitHub

Hello fellow humans!!

I've been doing front-end development projects for the last two years off and on. Throughout that time, I really didn't trust my work, so I simply dabbled. Now I feel more eager to learn and understand everything. In due time, I plan to study SQL/PHP, but I currently want to focus still on my projects and watching them grow.
